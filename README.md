# MoodChain-Web3-project
MoodChain is a blockchain-based mood diary that lets users record and retrieve moods securely on Educhain, ensuring immutable storage, transparency, and decentralized self-expression.


MoodChain is a decentralized application (dApp) built on EDU chain (open campus network) that enables users to record their mood on-chain. The project consists of a Solidity smart contract with two core functionalities:





Set Mood: Users can input and store their current mood on the blockchain.



Get Mood: Anyone can retrieve the most recently recorded mood from the smart contract.

Since blockchain data is immutable and publicly accessible, MoodChain allows users to express their emotions transparently while ensuring their entries remain secure and tamper-proof. This simple yet effective application demonstrates the power of smart contracts in personal data storage and decentralized journaling.
